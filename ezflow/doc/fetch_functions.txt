Fetch functions
===============
There are couple of fetch functions defined in the ezmedia module which can be used in templates:

    - waiting
    - valid
    - archived
    - valid_nodes

The description of these fetch functions follows:

waiting
-------
The fetch function has one parameter, block_id. Fetches the waiting items (items in the queue)
for a block identified by the block_id parameter. Result is the array of items represented
by an array with following keys:

    - block_id
    - object_id
    - node_id
    - priority
    - ts_publication
    - ts_visible
    - ts_hidden
    - rotation_until
    - moved_to

Example:

    fetch( 'ezmedia', 'waiting', hash( 'block_id', $block.id ) )

valid
-----
The same as the 'waiting' fetch function, but the array of valid items are returned.

archived
--------
The same as the 'waiting' fetch function, but the array of archived items (items in the archive)
are returned.

valid_nodes
-----------
The same as 'valid' fetch function, but the array of node objects (i.e. of eZContentObjectTreeNode
class) is returned. This fetch function should be used in the template rendering the block.
