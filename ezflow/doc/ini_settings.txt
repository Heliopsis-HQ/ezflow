Setting of new block types in block.ini
=======================================
When adding a new block type, you have to alter the block.ini settings.

Let's suppose, that the identifier of the new block type is "block_type".

Edit the block.ini, find the [General] group and add the block type to
the AllowedTypes[] variable:

    [General]
    AllowedTypes[]
    # ...
    AllowedTypes[]=block_type

Then create a group name created [block_type] and specify the following
variables (items marked with (*) are mandatory):

    - Name (*)
      Name of the block type as it will appear in the administration
      interface.
    
    - NumberOfValidItems (*)
      Maximum number of valid items (see pool.txt).
    
    - NumberOfArchivedItems (*)
      Maximum number of archived items.

    - ManualAddingOfItems (*) = disabled|enabled
      If enabled, an administrator/editor is allowed to add items to the
      queue (waiting items) manually.
    
    - TTL
      If set, the block will not be updated for the given amount of seconds.
      This might be useful when the content of the block is fetched from
      the external resources which might be slow and not very frequently updated.
      Good example might be the weather forecast fetched via SOAP from 
      an external server.

    - FetchClass (*)
      See pool.txt for more information. Name of the class which have defined
      the fetch() function getting new items.
    
    - FetchFixedParameters[] (*),
      FetchParameters[], FetchParametersIsRequired[]
      Some parameters to the fetch() function mentioned above might be
      either entered by an administrator/editor while editing a page definition
      (for example, a keyword in search fetch, a parent node ID of a section
      from which articles are going to be taken from) and some might be 
      fixed for the given block type.
      
      The set of fixed parameters is defined in FetchFixedParameters[], where
      a key of this array is the name of the parameter, for example:
      
        FetchFixedParameters[]
        FetchFixedParameters[Class]=article
      
      NB: as INI settings do not allow more-dimensional arrays, if you
          want to specify array, you have to enter it as string and then
          process it in your fetch function to create an array. For example
          an array of classes might be defined as:
          
        FetchFixedParameters[]
        FetchFixedParameters[Class]=article;folder
      
      Other parameters are specified by an administrator/editor in the administration
      interface. What is allowed to enter is specified by FetchParameters[]. Let's
      have a look at the following example:
      
        FetchParameters[]
        FetchParametersIsRequired[]
        FetchParameters[SourceID]=nodeID
        FetchParametersIsRequired[Subtrees]=true
        FetchParameters[Subtrees]=nodeIDs
        FetchParameters[Keyword]=string
        FetchParameters[SomeInteger]=integer

      The key of FetchParameters[] array gives the name of a parameter,
      the value specifies what type has to be entered:
      
        nodeID - node ID (in the administration interface an administrator/editor
                          browses for single node)
        nodeIDs - node IDs (in the administration interface an administrator/editor
                            browses for multiple nodes)
        string - one line text
        integer - integer number

      FetchParametersIsRequired[] specifies which of those parameters have
      to be entered.

      When calling fetch() function, an array with values of parameters
      with keys specifying the names of parameters is passed as the first argument.
      
      Note: there are two other arguments, check pool.txt for more information.
